of disaster.’

8. οὐδὲ λόγους—ἐδέχοντο, lit. ‘nor would they accept the

tratidae see Introduction, p. viii.

Notes 35

is ταύτῃ ‘by this way.’

οὔτε τις ἐφύλαττεν. A natural cleft in the rock runs under
or within the northern wall of the Acropolis. Where this
cleft is within the wall of the Acropolis, it has an opening at
the top which gives access to the plateau above it; but there
is a sheer drop of about 20 feet, which might well lead the
defenders to think it needed no guard ; and an attacking party,
once within the cleft, might ascend at their leisure with
sealing ladders or ropes (E. Gardner quoted by How and
Wells).

18. οὔτ᾽ ἐφοβεῖτο—ἀναβαίη, ‘nor feared that any one
might go up thereby (κατὰ ταῦτα). For the local sense of

Page 4

1. εἴτε δή, ‘whether it was that...’

2. εἴτε καὶ ἐνθύμιον—ἰερόν, ‘or even a religious scruple

Acropolis.’

6. ὥστε ἔνιοι—πραγμα, ‘so that some of the generals did

a united Greece; but each squadron (ἕκαστοι) will go its own
way (τρέψονται).

20. ἀνθρώπων, partitive genitive ‘among men.’

κατέχειν—μὴ οὐ διασκεδασθῆναι, ‘keep from being scattered

with the infinitive after a negative clause.

21. στρατιάν, ‘fleet,’ not ‘army.’

23. διαχέαι, aorist infinitive, ‘to confound their reso-

13. ῥαπίζονται, i.e. by the staves of the keepers of the

Cf. 25, 10; 29, 7.

οἱ δέ γε—οὐ στεφανοῦνται, ‘yes, and those who are left at
the post do not receive a wreath.’ Several writers add the
story that Eurybiades raised his stick to strike Themistocles,
who said, ‘Strike, but hear me.’

16. οὐκέτι οὐδέν, ‘no longer anything.’ See note on 4,
17, and cf. the next sentence, which means ‘in the presence of
the allies it was not bringing him credit to accuse any of them.’

of all advantageous to us, since our ships are of heavier build
and fewer in number.’ In the open sea the enemy could
surround the weaker Greek fleet; in the narrows their very
numbers would be against them, as well as their ignorance of
the fairway. The Greek ships were inferior to the enemy in
manoeuvring (How and Wells).

11. περιγίγνεται, ‘survives,’ ‘is saved’ there and then,—
graphic use of the present.

ἡμῖν, dative of person concerned, ‘for us,’—‘we have got
them conveyed away.’ Such a sentence helps us to understand
the use of the ‘dative of the agent.’

τίθημι, so also the compounds,

παῖδές τε καὶ γυναῖκες. See note on 1, 4.

reasonable plans reasonable success also (καὶ τοιαῦτα) is wont

Page 7

2. ἐπεφέρετο, lit. ‘was bearing down upon him,’ i.e. was
attacking him.

8. ᾧ μή ἐστι πατρίς, ‘who has no country.’

οὐδὲ—ἀνδρί, ‘and he forbade Eurybiades to put to the vote
a proposal made by a man without a city.’ Themistocles no
longer represented a city, he means.

4. τοῦτο δὲ—Αθῆναι, ‘thereby he meant that Athens was
occupied (by the Persians).’

6. ἐκεῖνον—κακὰ ἔλεγεν, double accusative. Cf. 13, 9.

celebration, nor any Athenians in the territory, Dicaeus still
fancied that he beheld the dust and heard the loud multitudi-
nous chant, which was wont to accompany in ordinary times
the processional march from Athens to Eleusis.’ For Eleusis

term ὀστρακισμός is derived from ὄστρακον, because the votes of
the Ecclesia deciding on the subject were recorded on earthen-
ware tablets. The process was employed only in times of
extreme civil strife. If it was decided that the state was in
danger, every Athenian citizen wrote down the name of the
statesman whom he thought dangerous. If there were 6000

ten years.

represented as early as this at the sterns of Athenian ships
(How and Wells).

19. μοι, dative of person concerned,—‘my men have

battle.’

14. τὰ ἱστία ἀράμενον, ‘having hoisted his sails.’ The

the trireme took down mast and sail and used only oars
(How and Wells).
